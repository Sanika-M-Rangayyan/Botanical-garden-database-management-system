# Botanical-garden-database-management-system

The pdf document contains detailed explanation of the database and table schemas.

The project aims at building a database management system for botanical garden which has its division across various 
places. Considering the huge number of plants present in the garden either as live plants or as herbarium vouchers,
managing the data efficiently helps in managing the garden adeptly. The end uses of the project are the garden 
managers across various gardens. The user can keep track of the plants that have been imported from other gardens or 
from other external sources, propagation of plants, plants that are preserved as herbarium vouchers and also periodic 
updates of each plant. Additionally, it also keeps a record of the suppliers who supply essential products and the 
employees working in the garden. The main purpose of the project is to keep track of the plant details efficiently so 
that the data can analysed in future to leverage the profit and plant culture of the garden.
